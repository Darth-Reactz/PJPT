# BurpSuite Tricks

- Burpsuite is a fantastic tool to look at websites and see where traffic is flowing, how it flows and if there are any redirects we can see.
- Burpsuite Simple setup
    - Install FoxyProxy on browser
    - point to burpsuite inside FoxyProxy
    - Enable proxy in Burp
    - Once we have this setup we can proceed to turn intercept on
    - Intercept on will grab any traffic and allow us to look at the get request. at this time we can right click the get and “send to repeater”
        - Once we send to repeater this is where we can edit the request and forward the traffic.
