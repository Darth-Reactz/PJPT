- Metasploit
    - You can run searchsploit and then the product you believe is vulnerable to have results returned to you on possible exploits to run
- Step 1: search the exploit in msfconsole

```jsx
search *exploit*
```

- Step 2: use and set options to for exploit, then run

```jsx
use *corresponding number*

options

set rhosts IPADDRESS

run
```

-RHOSTS, Remote Hosts

-LHOSTS, Local Host

-4444, Default Meterpreter port

*key tip: if the staged payload is not working try running a non staged payload to execute the exploit. vice versa. This can be done with the following command*

```jsx
set payload *use non staged or staged payload*
```

- Brute force SSH

```jsx
hydra -l root -P /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/unix_password.txt ssh://IPADRESS:22 -t 4 -V
```

-l, user

-P, Path

- In Metasploit ssh brute force
    - Login to msfconsole
    
    ```jsx

- Credential Stuffing
    - Injecting breached account credentials in hopes of account takeover
    - Stuffing is taking leak passwords from a leaked website such as LeakMe and attempt to use those emails and passwords against the website you are attacking, this can be done with burpsuite
    - Refer to Credential Stuffing Video in TCM
- Password Spraying
    - Password spraying is having known usernames with no known passwords
- Both of these attacks can be done with Burpsuite using intruder and sniper
