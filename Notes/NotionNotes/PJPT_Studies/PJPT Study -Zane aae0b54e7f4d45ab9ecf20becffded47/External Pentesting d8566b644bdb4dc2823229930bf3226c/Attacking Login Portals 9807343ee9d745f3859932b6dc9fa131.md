# Attacking Login Portals

- Attacking O365:
- Common tricks to use when attacking login portals in a large environment is to use the common season you are in, year you are in, company you are pentesting and city you are in
    - Example: Fall2024!
    - Example: Sooners1!
- Attacking Microsoft products:

The big reason Microsoft products are targeted is because they most likely tie in with Active Directory

- TrevorSpray: password spraying tool
    - This tool will validate emails for you from your information gathering steps. You can also spray a password against these users in the same tool
    - You can also proxy through machines to not use your current IP, this can be done through AWS
    - It can also detect account lockouts
- Make sure we know the account lockout policy from the client
    - **Do not lockout accounts for the client**
- In AWS, we can sign up for free and create free Ubuntu VMâ€™s
    - Once one Free machine is built we can select that machine and navigate to actions, image and templates, launch more like this.
    - Each box will have a different public IP address
    - SSH to the box first and accept the fingerprint, if this is NOT done first. TrevorSpray will NOT work
- Once we get a valid login for O365 we can have access to their entire O365 suite

- Attacking OWA(Outlook Web Access):
    - OWA can be attacked with Metasploit
    - You can set options against the IP of the OWA and target a list of users against a certain password commonly used
    - Even if we do not have a hit on the password on any accounts it will notify us if we have found a valid username
    - It will also notify if an account is locked out
