# Kerberoasting

The concept behind Kerberoasting is we have a compromised account and we can request a TGT to the KDC. In return we receive the TGT. After that process we request a TGS Ticket. (To request a TGS ticket you must present your TGT first) In the TGS response it will return the services account hash. 

Step 1:

```jsx
sudo GetUsersSPNs.py DOMAIN/USERNAME:PASSWORD -dc-ip IP ADDRESS -request
```

The return of this will return an SPN accounts hash

Step 2:

Attempt to crack the hash with hashcat

**SERVICE ACCOUNTS SHOULD NOT BE DOMAIN ADMINS**
