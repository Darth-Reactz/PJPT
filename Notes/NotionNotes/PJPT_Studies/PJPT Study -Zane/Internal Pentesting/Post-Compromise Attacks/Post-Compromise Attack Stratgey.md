# Post-Compromise Attack Strategy

- Search the quick wins
    - Kerberoasting
    - Secretsdump.py
    - Pass the hash / pass the password

When doing the quick ones constantly try to move laterally and vertically across the network and try and find more privilege

- If there are no quick wins, dig deep
    - Enumerate
    - What all access does your compromised account have?
    - Check old vulnerabilities
- Think outside the box always
- Try to move laterally until you can move vertically
