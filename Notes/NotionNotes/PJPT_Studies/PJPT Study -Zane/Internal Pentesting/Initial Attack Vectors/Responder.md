# Responder

**Responder**:

Responder is a tool used to exploit LLMNR. LLMNR is used to identify hosts when DNS fails to do so.

```jsx
sudo responder -I eth0 -dwP
```

When running this tool on the same subnet as the network, once some traffic is produced such as IP of kali box being accessed on the file explorer it will return the Client IP, Client Username, Clients Hash.
