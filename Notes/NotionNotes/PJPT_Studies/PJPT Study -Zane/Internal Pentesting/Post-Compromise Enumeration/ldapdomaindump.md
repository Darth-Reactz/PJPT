# ldapdomaindump

This tool does the same end result of MITM6 but it does not require using MITM6.

ldapdomaindump is to be used if we have a compromised accounts username and password. Once ran this will dump computers, groups, policies, and users by groups

```jsx
sudo ldapdomaindump ldaps://<dc ip address> -u 'USERNAME' -p PASSWORD
```
