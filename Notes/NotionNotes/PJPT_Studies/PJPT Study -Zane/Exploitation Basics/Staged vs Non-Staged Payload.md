# Staged vs Non-Staged Payload

A payload is a type of exploit being ran against a machine.

- Non-Staged Payload
    - Sends exploit shell code all at once
    - Larger in size and wont always work
    - Example: windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp
- Staged
    - Sends payload in stages
    - Can be less stable
    - Example: windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
